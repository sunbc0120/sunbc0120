## 🎒 Biography

I have a mixed background from STEM, with a Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering from China 🇨🇳, and a PhD on Thermodynamics from [NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx), Singapore 🇸🇬. I had also been a research student at [Tohoku University](http://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/), Japan 🇯🇵, and summer school attendee at [Wolfram Research](https://education.wolfram.com/summer/school/alumni/2013/sun/), US 🇺🇸. After a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship at [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/), Australia 🇦🇺 on [Computational Nano Physics and Chemistry](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z4j3xxUAAAAJ&hl=en), I left academia and took roles in the consulting industry, including at [McKinsey&Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/au/overview).

Currently I work as Senior Data Scientist at [AWS AI/ML Professional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning), leveraging data-driven methodology on the cloud, to deliver strategic business solutions to customers from different industry sectors. So far been leading projects in challenging areas including:

- 📷 Robotics Computer Vision
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Time Series Forecasting
- 💵 Price Optimisation
- 🛩️ Predictive Maintenance
- 💊 Pharmaceutical Development
- 🛒 Product Recommendation System

I'm especially passionate about computer vision and its edge computing utilisation; I also enjoy developing tools to democratise Data Science for stakeholders without technical background for them to focus on business value-adding with their proprietary data asset.
